This is the most simple example of using CircuitPython.
It prints "Hello World" to the serial console and display terminal.

When you connect your Picopad to your computer a drive with name CIRCUITPY will appear.

You can see file name code.py in the CIRCUITPY drive. This is the script that is run when you start your Picopad.

You can edit it in your favorite text editor to change the code.

The board will automatically reboot when you save the file.
